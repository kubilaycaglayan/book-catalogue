  about: [
    "Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky was born in Moscow in 1821. His debut, the epistolary novella Poor Folk (1846), made his name. In 1849 he was arrested for involvement with the politically subversive 'Petrashevsky circle' and until 1854 he lived in a convict prison in Omsk, Siberia. From this experience came The House of the Dead (1860-2). In 1860 he began the journal Vremya (Time). Already married, he fell in love with one of his contributors, Appollinaria Suslova, eighteen years his junior, and developed a ruinous passion for roulette. After the death of his first wife, Maria, in 1864, Dostoyevsky completed Notes from Underground and began work towards Crime and Punishment (1866). The major novels of his late period are The Idiot (1868), Demons (1871-2) and The Brothers Karamazov (1879-80). He died in 1881.<br /><br />(Russian: <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16321565.____________________________\" title=\"Фёдор Михайлович Достоевский\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Фёдор Михайлович Достоевский</a>) (see <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17062424.Fiodor_Dosto_evski\" title=\"Fiodor Dostoïevski\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Fiodor Dostoïevski</a>/<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18606930.Fi_dor_M__Dostoievski\" title=\"Fiódor M.

            'The Brothers Karamazov is a murder mystery, a courtroom drama, and an exploration of erotic rivalry in a series of triangular love affairs involving the “wicked and sentimental” Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov and his three sons―the impulsive and sensual Dmitri; the coldly rational Ivan; and the healthy, red-cheeked young novice Alyosha. Through the gripping events of their story, Dostoevsky portrays the whole of Russian life, is social and spiritual striving, in what was both the golden age and a tragic turning point in Russian culture.<br /><br />This award-winning translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky remains true to the verbal<br />inventiveness of Dostoevsky’s prose, preserving the multiple voices, the humor, and the surprising modernity of the original. It is an achievement worthy of Dostoevsky’s last and greatest novel.',

            'Returning to Russia from a sanitarium in Switzerland, the Christ-like epileptic Prince Myshkin finds himself enmeshed in a tangle of love, torn between two women—the notorious kept woman Nastasya and the pure Aglaia—both involved, in turn, with the corrupt, money-hungry Ganya. In the end, Myshkin’s honesty, goodness, and integrity are shown to be unequal to the moral emptiness of those around him. In her revision of the Garnett translation, Anna Brailovsky has corrected inaccuracies wrought by Garnett’s drastic anglicization of the novel, restoring as much as possible the syntactical structure of the original story.',

            "A collection of powerful stories by one of the masters of Russian literature, illustrating the author's thoughts on political philosophy, religion and above all, humanity: <i>Notes from Underground, White Nights, The Dream of a Ridiculous Man, and Selections from The House of the Dead</i> (150th Anniversary Edition)<br /><br />The compelling works presented in this volume were written at distinct periods in Dostoyevsky's life, at decisive moments in his groping for a political philosophy and a religious answer. From the primitive peasant who kills without understanding that he is destroying life to the anxious antihero of <i>Notes from Underground</i>—who both craves and despises affection—the writer's often-tormented characters showcase his evolving outlook on our fate.<br /><br />Thomas Mann described Dostoyevsky as \"an author whose Christian sympathy is ordinarily devoted to human misery, sin, vice, the depths of lust and crime, rather than to nobility of body and soul\" and <i>Notes from Underground</i> as \"an awe- and terror- inspiring example of this sympathy.\"",

            'Dostoevsky’s most revolutionary novel, <i>Notes from Underground</i> marks the dividing line between nineteenth- and twentieth-century fiction, and between the visions of self each century embodied. One of the most remarkable characters in literature, the unnamed narrator is a former official who has defiantly withdrawn into an underground existence. In complete retreat from society, he scrawls a passionate, obsessive, self-contradictory narrative that serves as a devastating attack on social utopianism and an assertion of man’s essentially irrational nature.<br /><br />Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, whose Dostoevsky translations have become the standard, give us a brilliantly faithful edition of this classic novel, conveying all the tragedy and tormented comedy of the original.',

What emerged was a prophetic and ferociously funny masterpiece of ideology and murder in pre-revolutionary Russia.',

Alexey tries to break through the wall of the established order in Russia, but instead becomes mired in the endless downward spiral of betting and loss. His intense and inescapable addiction is accentuated by his affair with the General’s cruel yet seductively adept niece, Polina. In <i>The Gambler</i>, Dostoevsky reaches the heights of drama with this stunning psychological portrait.',

            'White Nights, is a short story by Fyodor Dostoevsky that was published in 1848. Set in St. Petersburg, this is the story of a young man fighting his inner restlessness. A light and tender narrative, it delves into the torment and guilt of unrequited love. Both protagonists suffer from a deep sense of alienation that initially brings them together. A blend of romanticism and realism, the story appeals gently to the senses and feelings.',

            "Accused of political subversion as a young man, Fyodor Dostoyevsky was sentenced to four years of hard labor at a Siberian prison camp — a horrifying experience from which he developed this astounding semi-autobiographical memoir of a man condemned to ten years of servitude for murdering his wife.<br />As with a number of the author's other works, this profoundly influential novel brilliantly explores his characters' thoughts while probing the depths of the human soul. Describing in relentless detail the physical and mental suffering of the convicts, Dostoyevsky's character never loses faith in human qualities and the goodness of man.<br />A haunting and remarkable work filled with wonder and resignation, <i>The House of the Dead</i> ranks among the Russian novelist's greatest masterpieces. Of this powerful autobiographical novel, Tolstoy wrote, \"I know no better book in all modern literature.\"",

            'While his literary reputation rests mainly on such celebrated novels as <i>Crime and Punishment</i>, <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>, and <i>The Idiot</i>, Dostoyevsky also wrote much superb short fiction. <i>The Double</i> is one of the finest of his shorter works. It appeared in 1846 (his second published work) and is by far the most significant of his early stories, not least for its successful, straight-faced treatment of a hallucinatory theme.<br />In <i>The Double</i>, the protagonist, Golyadkin senior, is persecuted by his double, Golyadkin junior, who resembles him closely in almost every detail. The latter abuses the former with mounting scorn and brutality as the tale proceeds toward its frightening denouement. Characteristic Dostoyevskyan themes of helplessness, victimization, and scandal are beautifully handled here with an artistry that qualifies the story as a small masterpiece.<br />Students of literature, admirers of Dostoyevsky, and general readers will all be delighted to have this classic work available in this inexpensive but high-quality edition. <br />',

  description: [
    "A collection of powerful stories by one of the masters of Russian literature, illustrating the author's thoughts on political philosophy, religion and above all, humanity: <i>Notes from Underground, White Nights, The Dream of a Ridiculous Man, and Selections from The House of the Dead</i> (150th Anniversary Edition)<br /><br />The compelling works presented in this volume were written at distinct periods in Dostoyevsky's life, at decisive moments in his groping for a political philosophy and a religious answer. From the primitive peasant who kills without understanding that he is destroying life to the anxious antihero of <i>Notes from Underground</i>—who both craves and despises affection—the writer's often-tormented characters showcase his evolving outlook on our fate.<br /><br />Thomas Mann described Dostoyevsky as \"an author whose Christian sympathy is ordinarily devoted to human misery, sin, vice, the depths of lust and crime, rather than to nobility of body and soul\" and <i>Notes from Underground</i> as \"an awe- and terror- inspiring example of this sympathy.\"",
